Exercise 1


Write a method called distance that:


(1) accepts four integer coordinates: x1, y1, x2, y2 as parameters, 


(2) computes the distance between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) on the 
map, and 


(3) returns that distance. 


The equation for the distance is: 
..= 
..2-..12+..2-..12


Exercise 1 Cont.


Test out your program by writing a main method that calls the distance 
method for each of the following pairs of cities. Your main method 
should output the value returned by the distance method. 


Distance from 
Baltimare
to 
Manehattan
= 


Distance from Los Pegasus to 
Neighagra
Falls = 


Distance from the Badlands to 
Ponyville
=



Exercise 2


Princess Luna and 
Celestia
are going on a tour of the kingdom to greet 
the other citizens of 
Equestria
. Their tour takes them on a circular path 
(shown on map)


Write a method called 
roadTrip
that 


(1)
accepts as a parameter the diameter of the circular path, and 


(2) returns the length of the trip


The equation for circumference is: C = dp Java has a math constant 
called 
Math.PI



Exercise 3


Write a program that helps Princess Luna plan a 3
-
stop tour of 
Equestria
. 


Your program should prompt the user (in this case Princess Luna) for 
three destinations in 
Equestria
, as defined by their x and y coordinates 
on the map


You program should output the distance between the three 
destinations


You should use the distance methods you wrote for Exercise 1



Exercise 4


Write a method called 
totalTrip
that accepts parameters for 3 locations 
(each containing coordinates) and returns the total distance traveled by 
visiting all 3 locations and returning to the starting location. 
You should use the distance methods you wrote in Exercise 2 and you 
can choose any 3 locations in 
Equestria
.


Extra credit: make this program compute 4 locations instead!
