Calculating a Pok�mon's EV:


Pok�mon have experience values which they gain when one Pok�mon 
wins against another


These values are private (the user cannot see them) so in order to 
know what your EV is, you need to compute it yourself


Let�s write a program that helps us calculate EV!



Calculating a Pok�mon's EV:


import java.util.*


Scanner 
userInput
= new Scanner (System.in);



Calculating a Pok�mon's EV:


System.out.print
(�Hit points:�);


int
hp
= 
userInput.nextInt
();


System.out.print
(�Level: �);


int
level = 
userInput.nextInt
();



Calculating a Pok�mon's EV:


System.out.print
(�IV: �);


int
iv = 
userInput.nextInt
();


System.out.print
(�Base HP: �);


int
base = 
userInput.nextInt
();



Calculating a Pok�mon's EV:


//The Pok�mon's EV is calculated using the input variables!


int
ev
= (((
hp
�
10) * 100)/
level
�
2 * 
base
�
iv
�
100) * 4;


System.out.println
(�You have � + 
ev
+ � effort value points 
for your HP stat.�);
