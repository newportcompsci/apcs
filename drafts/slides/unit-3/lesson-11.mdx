
Reducing Redundancy


[ 3.11 ] [ Today�s Date ] [ Instructor Name ]



Classroom Competition



Factor out redundant code from the following example by moving it 
out of the if/else statement, preserving the same output.


if (x < 30) { 


a = 2; 


x++; 


System.out.println
(�
Spongebob
Squarepants
! � + x); 


} else { 


a = 2; 


System.out.println
(�
Spongebob
Squarepants
! � + x); 


}



int
sum = 1000; 


Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);


System.out.print
(�Is your money multiplied 1 or 2 times? �);


int
times = 
console.nextInt
(); 


if (times == 1) { 


System.out.print
(�And how much are you contributing? �); 


int
donation = 
console.nextInt
(); 


sum = sum + donation; 


count1++; 


total = total + donation; 


} 


if (times == 2) { 


System.out.print
(�And how much are you contributing? �); 


int
donation = 
console.nextInt
(); 


sum = sum + 2 * donation; 


count2++; 


total = total + donation; 


}


Rewrite the poorly
-
structured code given here, so it avoids redundancy. 


For the case of this competition, you can assume that the user always inputs 1 or 2.
