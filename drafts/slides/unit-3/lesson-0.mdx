Test Review:


Do you have any questions about the test?



1. What is a 
variable
?


(A)

Combining several Strings into a single String, or combining a String 
with other

(A)
1 


(B) 1.5 


(C) 2

21


(B) 123456 


(C) �6456�


(D) "123456" 


(E) Nothing, because Java expressions cannot mix
int
and
String types.



11. Consider the following code segment:


for (
int
i
= 2; 
i
<= 8; 
i
+= 2) {


System.out.print
(
i
+ ", ");


}


System.out.println
("Whom do we appreciate?");


What is output when this code segment is executed?

= 1; 
i
<= 3; 
i
++)

("Hey");


System.out.println
("
ya
!");


What is output when this code segment is executed?
Hint: curly braces { } are missing. 



14. Consider the following complete program:


public class 
MyStars
{


public static void 
printStar
() {


System.out.println
(" * ");


}


public static void 
loopStars
() {


for (
int
i
= 0; 
i
< 2; 
i
++) {


for (
int
j = 1; j <= 
i
; 
j++
) {


printStar
();


}


}


}


public static void main(String[] 
args
) {


loopStars
();


} 


}

*
are printed to the console when this program is executed? 


(A)
None 


(B) 1 


(C) 2 


(D) 6 


(E) 10 



15. Consider the following code segment:


What is the 
scope 
for the variable x?



16. Consider the following complete program:


public class 
PrintSquaresAndCubes
{


public static void main(String[] 
args
) {


for (
int
i
= 1; 
i
<= 10; 
i
++) {


System.out.println
( 
i
+ " squared is " + ( 
i
* i ));


}


for (
int
i
= 1; 
i
<= 10; 
i
++) {


System.out.println
(
i
+ " cubed is " + ( 
i
* 
i
* 
i
));


}


} 


}


Suppose we add the following CLASS_CONSTANT to the program:


public static final 
int
MAX_VALUE = 10;


What is the most appropriate use of MAX_VALUE? 



(A)
To replace the value 10 in the for loop, so we can change the output 


of the
program more easily by adjusting MAX_VALUE.


(B) To replace method header public static void main(String[] 
args
),


because the program will become shorter. 


(C) To replace the expression (
i
* 
i
* 
i
), which is too complicated for a
simple program. 


(D) To replace the class header public class 
PrintSquaresAndCubes
,


which has too many capital letters in it. 


(E) Hello, world.
