What are these things?


for (
int
i
= 0; 
i
< 4
; 
i
++) {


System.out.println
(
i
)


}


int
j = 0;


while (
j * j < 20
){


System.out.println
(j);


j = j * 2 
�
1;


}



boolean
: the easiest type!


Only two values:


true


false


<expression>
<relational operator>
<expression>


3 * 3, x
==, !=
3 * 1 * 3, y

Operator


Meaning


Example


Value


==


equals


1 + 1 == 2


!=


does not equal


3.2 != 2.5


<


less than


10 < 5


>


greater than


10 > 5


<=


less than or equal to


126 <= 100


>=


greater than or equal to


5.0 >= 5.0





Boolean Logic


Expanding on true and false: 
!, &&, and ||


AND
(4 == 4) && (2 > 1)
Evaluates to: true


OR
(1 < 2) || (2 < 1)
Evaluates to: true


NOT
!(2 < 1)
Evaluates to: true



Boolean Logic


if(q == 1 || 2 || 4){
//This doesn�t work


statement;
//you need to use full


statement;
//
boolean
expression!


}


if(q == 1 || q == 2 || q == 4){


statement;


statement;


}
