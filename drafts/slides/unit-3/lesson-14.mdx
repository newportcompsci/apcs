When do we use randomization?


Create an enemy that spawns after some random amount of time, but between 7 
and 23 seconds.

Let�s make some random numbers:


How do we make a random object?

How do we make a random object?


Random r = new Random();



Let�s make some random numbers:


Random r = new Random();


result = 
r.nextInt
(6); //Gives a number between 0 and 5


result = 
r.nextInt
(6) + 1; //between 1 and 6.


System.out.println
(�You rolled a � + result);
