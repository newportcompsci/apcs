A program that returns a value:


Parameters can be manipulated, but don�t change.


int
x = 10


change10to9(10); //THIS DOESN�T WORK!!


public static void change10to9(
int
x) {


x 
-
= 1;


} //WHY?


So how do we get returned values?



The new method header:


public static double sum(double n){


}



The new method header:


public static double sum(double n){


return (n + 1) * n / 2;


}

Pok�mon Challenge


A Pok�mon's base stat values will most often have the greatest 
influence over their specific stats at any level. 
A level 100 Pok�mon's stats in Attack, Defense, Speed, Special Attack, 
and Special Defense will be exactly 5 more than double its base stat 
values in each (leaving out individual values, effort values, and nature).
The Hit Points (HP) stat will be 110 plus double the base stat value 
(except in the case of 
Shedinja
, whose HP is always 1).
