Categories of loops


definite loops: 
Executes a known number of times.


�
e.g. 
for
loops
�
Print �hello� 10 times.
�
Find all the prime numbers up to integer n.
�
Print each odd number between 5 and 127.




indefinite loops: 
One where the number of times it�s run is not known.


�
Prompts the user until they type a non
-
negative number.
�
Print random numbers until a prime number is printed.
�
Repeat until the user types �q� to quit.





The 
while
loop:


while
loop : Repeatedly executes its body as long as the test is true.


while (test) {


statements(s);


}


Example:


int
num
= 1;


while (
num
<= 200) {


System.out.print
(
num
+ � �);


num
= 
num
* 2;


}



while loop


int
i
= 0;


while (
i
< 10) {


System.out.println
(
i
);


i
++;


}


for loop


for (
int
i
= 0; 
i
< 10; 
i
++) {


System.out.println
(
i
);


}


What�s the difference?



Think
-
pair
-
share:


How many times does this loop execute? 


What is the output?


Try rewrite this loop as a for loop.


int
n = 91;


int
factor = 2;


while (n % factor != 0) {


factor++;


}


System.out.println
(�First factor is � + factor);
