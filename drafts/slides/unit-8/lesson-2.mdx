What makes a method recursive?


How would we write a recursive method? 


In pseudocode or code if possible!

What makes a method recursive?


Base case:


A case within a recursive solution that is 


so simple, it can solved without needing 


to call the method again.


Recursive case:


A case within a recursive solution that 


involves reducing the overall problem to a


simpler problem of the same kind that 


can be solved with a recursive call.



A recursive method:


public static void 
writeStars
(
int
x) {


if (x == 0) {


System.out.println
();


} else {


System.out.println
(�*�);


writeStars
(x 
�
1);


}


}



Wrong recursion:


public static void 
writeStars
(
int
x) {


System.out.print
(�*�);


writeStars
(n 
-
1);


}


What is the output of this recursive call?
