Recursive Application


Now that we know recursion, we can do merge sort.


Like selection and insertion sort, merge sort works on arrays.

Merge sort worst case performance is O(n log n)



Merge sort in action:
On paper, plan out all of the 
steps to merge sort.


recursive <strong>merge sort</strong> algorithm used to <strong>sort</strong> an array of 7 integer ...

Steps to merge sort:


Split the array into two halves down to


one element.


Sort the left half.


Sort the right half


Merge the two halves together.

Maintain a current index for each list starting at 0.


Create an empty list to hold the result.


When we haven�t exhausted our two lists,


insert the smallest element at the point and advance the index.


The merge:


14


32


67


76




23


41


58


85




14




23




32

76




85





MergeSort


The algorithm:


If the list�s size is 0 or 1, just return the original list (as it is stored).


Split the list parameter into two lists, of (roughly) equal size.


Sort both split lists, list 1 and list 2.


Merge the two sorted lists (list 1 and list 2), and return the result.
