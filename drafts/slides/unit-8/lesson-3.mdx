Slide reserved for teacher demo, scratch MIT 
dragon curve, etc. Any way you think would best 
model recursion for your respective class.
The Lesson Plan has great examples and activities 
to choose from.

Koch Curve


1. 
Divide the line segment into three segments of equal length


2. 
Draw an equilateral triangle that has the middle segment from 
step 1 as its base and points outward


3. 
Remove the line segment that is the base of the triangle from 
step 2


4. 
Recur
