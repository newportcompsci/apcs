Dog
Object


What behaviors (methods) and data (states) does a common dog have?

Objects = State (Data) + Behavior (Methods)


// Data is stored in an array.


int
[] digits = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9, 10};


// Method dictates actions.


System.out.println
(
Arrays.toString
(digits));



Why isn�t this an object or model?


while (guess != number) {


System.out.println
(�Incorrect.�);


System.out.println
(�Your guess? �);


guess = 
console.nextInt

numGuesses
++;


}



Client Code


Code that uses the object.


What program (client code) might need to access the data and 
methods stored in:

Fields
: outline what data (state) the object will hold.


Methods
: outlines the behavior of each object.


Constructor
: code that initializes the object being constructed.

Encapsulation
can protect the data stored in the object.

Fields


public class 
Pokemon
{


//What are some examples of fields


//What would fields look like for


\
//a student, dog, or forecast?


}

Methods


What would be a good method to include in all instances of Students?


What would be a good method for all instances of the Dog class?


What method should all forecasts have, no matter what forecast?



Methods: Pok�mon


Pok�mon get an effort ribbon if their combined stats exceed a certain 
value 
�
what�s a good way to get all of a Pok�mon's stats?


What would the method 
sumStats
look like?



sumStats
:


public 
int
sumStats
() {


return(HP + attack + defense + 
specialAttack
+ 
specialDefense
+ speed);


}



Methods: 
Pokemon


Pokemon
use vitamins to boost their stats. Here are some examples:


Vitamin
Function


hpUp
+ points to HP


protein
+ points to attack


iron
+ points to defense


Now write a method, 
consumeVitamin
, that actually changes the state.



consumeVitamin


public void 
consumeVitamin
( 
int
hpUp
, 
int
protein �) {


hp
+= 
hpUp
;


attack += protein;


�


}



Constructors


We need to initialize our values of each instance of the Pok�mon class.


This is done in the constructor:


public class 
Pokemon
{


int
hp
;


int
attack;


public 
Pokemon
(
int
hitpoints
, 
int
a) { 


hp
= 
hitpoints
;


attack = a;


}


}



Constructors


We can then call these constructors to create our instances:


Pok�mon 
pikachu
= new Pok�mon(70, 120);


We can also call our methods on the object:


pikachu.sumStats
(); 
//returns 190
