How would you write the following program:


How many days’ temperatures? 
7


Day 1’s high temp: 
45


Day 2’s high temp: 
44


Day 3’s high temp: 
39


Day 4’s high temp: 
48


Day 5’s high temp: 
37


Day 6’s high temp: 
46


Day 7’s high temp: 
53


Average temp = 44.6


4 days were above average.

System.out.println
(“How many days?”);


int

scanner.nextInt

for (
int

}


How do you calculate the days with temperatures above average?

How do you calculate the days with temperatures above average?


You would need to store the temperature for every day.



Arrays:


Array: 
object that stores many values of the same type.


Element: 
one value in an array.


Index: 
a 0
-
based integer to access an element from an array.

Example:


int

Arrays and 
for
loops (Typical pattern)


int
[] numbers = new 
int
[8];


for (
int

}


•
For loop 
starts at 0
•
Condition is “
