Day 1’s high temp: 
45


Day 2’s high temp: 
44

You would need to store the temperature for every day.

metroCardRides


int
[] 
metroCardRides
= {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};


How would you reorganize this array (within your code) so that the 5 
moves from the first element to the last element? 


*You cannot reinitialize the array.



Store the first value in the array.


int
first = 
metroCardRides
[0];


How do we assign each value in the array to the next value in the array?


Hint: Try using a for loop to cycle through!



Cycle through the array:


for (
int
j = 0; j < 
metroCardRides.length
–
1; 
j++
){


metroCardRides
[j] = 
metroCardRides
[j + 1];


}


What additional code do we need to add to finish our array?


Hint: Our array is currently: 


4


3


2


1

Good job:


public static void 
firstToLast
(
int
[] 
metroCardRides
) {


int
first = 
metroCardRides
[0];


for (
int
j = 0; j < 
metroCardRides.length
–
1; 
j++
) {


metroCardRides
[j] = 
metroCardRides
[j + 1];


}


metroCardRides
[
metroCardRides.length
–
1] = first;


}


How can we do the opposite? Move the last element to the front?



The opposite:


public static void 
firstToLastRight
(
int
[] 
metroCardRides
){


int
last = 
metroCardRides
[
metroCardRides.length
–
1];


for (
int
j = 
metroCardRides.length
–
1; j >= 1; 
j++
){


metroCardRides
[j] = 
metroCardRides
[j 
–
1];


}


metroCardRides
[0] = last;


}
