[ 7.02 ] [ Today�s Date ] [ Instructor Name ]



Sorting


Which searching method was faster? (what are those methods)


What was a prerequisite for that search?


What are examples where it might be important to store data?



As you arrive�


Think of 3 examples where your phone, tablet, or computer 
needs to sort things in order.



Sorting algorithms


�
There are many sorting algorithms.
�
Some take more time.
�
Some use more memory.
�
Some are simple and some are complex.
�
Initially, we�ll learn about 2 simple ones:


-
selection sort


-
insertion sort

Selection Sort


Think of the array as having two parts:


Sorted part at the left


Unsorted part at the right


Repeatedly put the smallest unsorted value into its final position (at the 
end of the sorted section)



Selection Sort


The algorithm:


Look through the list and find the smallest value.


Swap it so that it�s at index 0.


Look through the list and find the second smallest value.


Swap it so that it is at index 1.


�


Repeat until all values are in their proper places.



Selection Sort


public
static
void
selectionSort
(
int
[] a) 


{


for
(
int
i = 0; i < a.
length
-
1; i++) 
{


// find index of smallest remaining value


int
min = 
i
;


for
(
int
j = 
i
+ 1; j < 
a.
length
; 
j++
) 
{


if
(a[j] < a[min]) 


min = j;


}


// swap smallest value into its proper place, a[
i
]


int
temp = a[
i
];


a[
i
] = a[min];


a[min] = temp;


}


}

Insertion Sort


For insertion sort, we used arrays.


Arrays don�t let you insert 
in the middle
.


So how did we insert the next unsorted element where it belongs?


We slide it into place!



Insertion Sort: Array


public
static
void
insertionSort
(
int
[] a) 
{


for
(
int
i 
= 1
; 
i
< 
a
.
length
; 
i
++) 
{


for
(
int
j
= 
i
; 
j
> 0 && 
a
[
j
] < 
a
[
j
-
1]; 
j
--
) {


int
temp = 
a
[
j
];


a
[
j
] = 
a
[
j
-
1];


a
[
j
-
1] = temp;


}


}


}



Insertion Sort: 
ArrayList


public
static
void
insertionSort
(
ArrayList
<Integer> 
a
)
{


for
(
int
i
= 1; 
i
< 
a
.size
(); 
i
++)
{


for
(
int
j
= 
i
; 
j
> 0 && 
a
.get
(
j
) < 
a
.get
(
j
-
1); 
j
--
)
{


int
temp
= 
a
.get
(
j
);


a
.set
(
j
, 
a
.get
(
j
-
1));


a
.set
(
j
-
1, 
temp
);


}


}


}


1.
Remove 
i
th
element
2.
Find where it belongs
3.
Insert it into place

{


for
(

{


1. How do we remove the 
i
th
element?


}


}

{

2. Where does the value belong?


3. How do we insert the value at that place?


}

Comparison: 
ArrayList
vs Array Insertion Sort


Our 
ArrayList
implementation is�


More intuitive (no sliding necessary)


More like how we�d sort a hand of cards IRL


Maybe easier to read


Is it faster?


�
The 
ArrayList
still has to do the same number of exchanges
�
The code is merely hidden from us, but it�s still there
�
So no, not faster
