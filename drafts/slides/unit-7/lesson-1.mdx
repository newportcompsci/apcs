
Searching Algorithm


[ 7.01 ] [ Today�s Date ] [ Instructor Name ]



Computers are good at managing large 
collections of data quickly and easily:


Image result for bar codes

Air separation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

We use searching all the time:


Finding the right pants on Amazon


Researching a topic on Wikipedia


Finding that picture you took two years ago


Selecting a song to exercise to

We need to search for a specific data point:


Example:


When you search the internet, you�re looking for a single 
keyword (�or phrase�) called a �search key� within a webpage


When you input your student number, it searches through a 
database of accounts for one associated with your number



Using algorithms:


We need to use algorithms to quickly search our datasets


Imagine if each 
websearch
took 3 seconds long


Imagine if each item scanned at a grocery store took 10 seconds to find



When we decide as program designers which 
searching or sorting to use, we factor in:


1.
The size of the data array
2.
The space efficiency of the algorithm (memory)
3.
Run
-
time efficiency (how fast it executes)

Search method:


1.
Take an array of integers 
arr
2.
And an integer 
n
,
3.
And returns a 
boolean
indicating if 
n 
appears somewhere in 
arr.



Sequential (Linear) Search


Locates a target value in an array/list by examining each element from 
start to finish.


How many elements will it need to examine?


Searching the array below for the value 42:


i



Binary Search


Locates the target value in a sorted array/list by successively 
eliminating half of the array from consideration.


How many elements will it need to examine?


Example: Searching the array below for the value 42:


Binary needs to be sorted!


min


mid


max
