# Declaring and Assigning Variables

---

## Variables

- A piece of the computer's memory that is given a name and type 
- Can store a value

> Example: preset station on a car stereo or cell phone speed dial

---

## Step 1: Declare the variable

Sets aside memory for storing a value

Variables must be declared before the variable can be used

Syntax:

```raw
<type> <variable name>;
```

---

## String is the type we have learned so far

`name` is an identifier

Naming convention is camel casing: lower case first letter

Example: 
```java
String myStringVar;
```

---

## Step 2: Assign the variable

Stores a value to the space reserved for the variable

Syntax:

```raw
<variable name> = <expression>;
```

> the value stored can be updated as many times as needed 

---

## Assignment and Declaring

a value can be assigned the same time it is declared:

```raw
<type> <variable name> = <expression>;
```

Example:

```java
String myStringVar = "Hello there";
```

---

## Step 3: Using the variable

The variable's name can be used wherever you need to use that value

Syntax:
```raw
System.out.println(<variable name>);
```

---

## The variable can be used as many times as needed

changing the variable's value will be reflected in the code that used the variable 
later in the execution


Example:

```java
String myStringVar = "Hello there";
System.out.println(myStringVar);
myStringVar = "Goodbye";
System.out.println(myStringVar);
```

Output:

```raw
hello there
Goodbye
```

---

## Common Complier Errors

- A variable cannot be used until it is assigned
- Variable names cannot be declared twice
- If the variable name is mistyped, the compiler will say the variable is undeclared
