# Basic Data Concepts

---

## Data Types

Two data type groups in Java:
- Primitive: int , double, char, boolean
- Objects: String - we'll deal with these later.

---

## Data Types

Type: a name for a category of data values that are related.

- int: describes all whole numbers, or integers.
- double: describes all numbers with decimal points.
- boolean: describes logical values true or false.

---

## Expressions

Expression: a simple value or set of operations that produces a value 

```java
14
29.0009
12 + 6 * 9 - 1
```

---

## Arithmetic Operators

Operator: a special symbol used to indicate that an operation is to be performed.

- \+ plus
- \- minus
- \* multiply
- / divide
- % modulus

## Precedence

Just like you would expect in a normal math class

Everything is solved left to right!

### PEMDAS
- P arentheses
- E xponent (ignore this for now)
- M ultiply / 
- D ivide / Modulus
- A ddition / 
- S ubtraction

---

## Computer Arithmetic

Dividing two int values always results in a single int (always truncated: rounded down)

```java
10 / 2 = 5 
15 / 2 = 7 
19 / 10 = 1 
```

---

## Dividing with a double results in a double

```java
15 / 2.0 = 7.5
```

---

## Example problems:

```java
7 / 3 * 1.2 + 3 / 2

1 * 2 + 3 * 5 % 4

1 + 8 % 3 * 2 - 9
```

---

## Intro to String Concatenation : Expressions with Strings

Converts other types to String Obeys Order of Operations

## Examples

```java
"hello" + 4 = "hello4"

"hello" + 4 + 2 = "hello42"

4 + 2 + "hello" = "6hello"

"hello" + (4 + 2) = "hello6"

"hello" + 4 * 2 = "hello8"
```

## Lab

Do the TOP 5 PROBLEMS ONLY from each of the following:


- BJP3 Self-Check 2.2: expressions1 (top 5 only)
- BJP3 Self-Check 2.3: expressions2 (top 5 only)
- BJP3 Self-Check 2.4: expressions3 (top 5 only)

If the answer is a String, you must enclose the answer in "double-quotes"
