Basic Data Concepts


[ 2.01 ] [ Today’s Date ] [ Instructor Name ]



Data Types


Two data type groups in Java:


•
Primitive


int
, double, char, 
boolean


•
Objects


String
, … 
-
we’ll deal with these later.



Data Types


Type
: a name for a category of data values that are related.


•
int
: describes all whole numbers, or integers.
•
double
: describes all numbers with decimal points.
•
boolean
: describes logical values 
–
true or false.



Expressions


Expression
: a simple value or set of operations that produces a value


14


29.0009


12 + 6 * 9 
-
1



Arithmetic Operators


Operator
: a special symbol used to indicate that an 
operation is to be performed.


+
plus


-
minus


*
multiply


/
divide


%
modulus



Precedence


Just like you would expect in a normal math class


Everything is solved left to right!


PEMDAS


•
P
arentheses
•
E
xponent (ignore this for now)
•
M
ultiply / 
D
ivide / Modulus
•
A
ddition / 
S
ubtraction



Computer Arithmetic


Dividing two 
int
values always results in a single 
int


(always truncated: rounded down)


10 / 2 = 5


15 / 2 = 7


19 / 10 = 1


Dividing with a double results in a double


15 / 2.0 = 7.5


Example problems:


7 / 3 * 1.2 + 3 / 2


1 * 2 + 3 * 5 % 4


1 + 8 % 3 * 2

Intro to String Concatenation : Expressions with Strings


Converts other types to String


Obeys Order of Operations


Examples


“hello” + 4 =
“hello4”


“hello” + 4 + 2 = 
“hello42”


4 + 2 + “hello” = 
“6hello”


“hello” + (4 + 2) = 
“hello6”


“hello” + 4 * 2 = 
“hello8”

Declaring and Assigning Variables


[ 2.02] [ Today’s Date ] [ Instructor Name ]



Variables


A piece of the computer’s memory that is given a name and type


Can store a value


Example: preset station on a car stereo or cell phone speed dial



Step 1: Declare the variable
Sets aside memory for storing a value


Variables must be declared before the variable can be used


Syntax:


<
type> <variable name>;


•
String
is the type we have learned so far
•
name
is an identifier
•
Naming convention is camel casing: lower case first letter
Example: 
myVariableName


Example:


String 
myStringVar
;



Step 2: Assign the variable
Stores a value to the space reserved for the variable


Syntax:


<variable name> = <expression>;


•
the value stored can be updated as many times as needed
•
a value can be assigned the same time it is declared:
<type> <variable name> = <expression>;


Example:


String 
myStringVar
= “Hello there”;



Step 3: Using the variable
The variable’s name can be used wherever you need to use that value


Syntax:


System.out.println
(<variable name>);


•
the variable can be used as many times as needed
•
changing the variable’s value will be reflected in the code that used the variable 
later in the execution


Example:
String 
myStringVar
= “Hello there”;
System.out.println
(
myStringVar
);
myStringVar
= “Goodbye”;
System.out.println
(
myStringVar
);


Output:


hello there
Goodbye



Common Complier Errors


A variable cannot be used until it is assigned


Variable names cannot be declared twice


If the variable name is mistyped, the compiler will say the variable is 
undeclared

String Concatenation and Increment


[ 2.03] [ Today’s Date ] [ Instructor Name ]



Intro to String Concatenation : Expressions with Strings


Converts other types to 
String


Obeys Order of Operations


Examples


•
“hello” + 4 =
“hello4”
•
“hello” + 4 + 2 = 
“hello42”
•
4 + 2 + “hello” = 
“6hello”
•
“hello” + (4 + 2) = 
“hello6”
•
“hello” + 4 * 2 = 
“hello8”



Examples:


•
1 + 2 + 3 + “chocolate” = ??? 
•
“chocolate” + 1 + 2 + 3 = ???
•
“chocolate” + (1 + 2) + 3 = ???
•
“chocolate” + (1 + 2) / 3 = ???



Examples


System.out.println
(“
Spongebob
thinks “ + “the best time 
to wear a sweater” + “ is all the time!”);


System.out.println
(“Here we combine “ + 1 + “ integer” + 
“ with strings!”);


System.out.println
(42 + “ is the answer to” + 
“everything!” + 1 + 1);



Introduction to Increment


In Java, there are ways to increase/decrease a variable without writing 
the whole equation!


x = x + 7 ; 
OR
x += 7;


y = y / 3 ; OR y /= 3;


x++; OR ++x


y++; OR ++y

Mixing Types & Casting


[ 2.04 ] [ Today’s Date ] [ Instructor Name ]



Zombies, Werewolves, and Humans


What do you think would happen if a zombie bit a werewolf?


So : Zombie > Werewolf > Human?


Same thing happens when we mix together different types



Strings, doubles, and integers


Think about our past examples:


1 + 9.0 = 10.0


1 + “hello” = “1hello”


1 + 2.0 + “hello” = “3.0hello”


So: 
String > double > 
int



If you combine an
int
and a 
double
with 
an operator 
(+ 
-
* / % 
) the result is …?



If you combine an
int
and a 
String
with 
a ‘
+

If you combine an
double
