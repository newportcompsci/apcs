Zombies, Werewolves, and Humans


What do you think would happen if a zombie bit a werewolf?


So : Zombie > Werewolf > Human?


Same thing happens when we mix together different types



Strings, doubles, and integers


Think about our past examples:


1 + 9.0 = 10.0


1 + �hello� = �1hello�


1 + 2.0 + �hello� = �3.0hello�


So: 
String > double > 
int



If you combine an
int
and a 
double
with 
an operator 
(+ 
-
* / % 
) the result is �?



If you combine an
int
and a 
String
with 
a �
+
� the result is �?



If you combine an
double
and a 
String
with a �
+
� the result is �?



Promoting


In Java we call this promoting!


int
: 1


double: 1.0


String: �one�

Note: 
String
is not a primitive type and cannot be cast. Java will convert 
int
and 
double
to 
strings when concatenated with a string.
