Review: subclass vs. superclass


subclass �extends� superclass


superclass: 
More general, less capability


subclass: 
More specific, more capability


Think of a subclass as being �better� than a superclass.



Variables and Classes


Variable can hold objects of its type or �better� (subclass is �better�!)


Same goes for parameters and fields.


If:
public class Lion extends Animal { � }


Then:
Animal 
simba
= new Animal();


Or:
Animal 
simba
= new Lion();



Variables and Classes


The reverse is NOT true!


If:
public class Lion extends Animal { � }


Then:
Lion 
simba
= new Lion();


NOT:
Lion 
simba
= new Animal();
(Lions > Animals)



Once again:


IF a variable points to an objects�


THEN the object must be of the same type as the variable or �better�


That means that the object can be a subtype of the variable type!



Polymorphism


The ability to use the same code with different types of objects and 
behave differently with each.


Animal 
simba
= new Lion();


What behaviors does this object have?



Polymorphism


public class Lion extends Animal { � }


Animal 
simba
= new Lion();


System.out.prinln
(
simba.say
());


Output: �
Rawr
!!�



The Exercise


Given the preceding classes, what would be the 
output
of the following client code?


MusicalInstrument
[] 
insts
= {


new 
MusicalInstrument
(), new 
ElectricKeyboard
(),


new Guitar(), new 
ElectricGuitar
() };


for (
int
i
= 0; 
i
< 
insts.length
; 
i
++) {


System.out.println
(
insts
[
i
]);


insts
[
i
].
pickSound
();


insts
[
i
].
playNote
();


System.out.println
();


}



Step 1: Class Diagram


Add classes from top (superclass)


to bottom (subclass).

Step 3: Write It Up


MusicalInstrument
[] 
insts
= {


new 
MusicalInstrument
(), new 
ElectricKeyboard
(),


new Guitar(), new 
ElectricGuitar
() };


for (
int
i
= 0; 
i
< 
insts.length
; 
i
++) {


System.out.println
(
insts
[
i
]);


insts
[
i
].
pickSound
();


insts
[
i
].
playNote
();


System.out.println
();


}
