Overriding Methods & 
Accessing Inherited Code


[ 6.02 ] [ Today�s Date ] [ Instructor Name ]



When might we not want inherited methods?



Problems with inheritance


Subclass 
FootballPlayer
may have a different 
throwing
method 
than superclass 
Athlete
.


Subclass 
SoccerPlayer
may even ignore the method (design choice, 
soccer players cannot throw!)



Overriding: chug


// 
SugarFreeDrink


public void chug(double gulp) {


System.out.println
(�Yuck, this tastes terrible!�)


}



Overriding: chug


public void chug(double gulp) {


if (ounces < gulp) {


throw new 
IllegalArgumentException
();


} else {


System.out.println
(�Glug, glug, glug!�);


ounces 
-
= gulp;


System.out.println
(�You have � + ounces + �oz.


+ of drink left.�);


}


}



Overriding: chug


//new chug method, 
SugarFreeDrink


public void chug(double gulp) {


System.out.println
(�Yuck, this tasted terrible!�);


super.chug
(gulp);


}



How do we access encapsulated information?



get
methods:


public double 
getName
() 
{ 
//written in superclass


return name;


}


public void advertising() {


System.out.println
(�Avoid the extra calories by 
drinking delicious � + 
getName
()
+ �every day!!�);


}
