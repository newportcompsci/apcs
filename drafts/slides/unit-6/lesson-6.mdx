[ 6.06 ] [ Today�s Date ] [ Instructor Name ]



What are some limitations to inheritance?


Can we inherit code from more than one superclass?


Can we have an is
-
a relationship or polymorphism without giving the 
subclass access to our code?



Interfaces


Offer a means to share a common 
supertype
without sharing the code.


An interface consists of a set of method declarations without bodies.


A promise of behavior; methods are declared but not defined.


The method will be defined in the subclass.


An error will be thrown if you don�t define the method.



Interface in practice:


Edible


Greasy


Aromatic


Pork


Bacon


Lard


Salty



Declaring Interfaces


public interface Salty{


double 
sodiumContent
(); 
.
this is a promise to implement the 
sodiumContent


}
in the class that implements the Salty interface.


public interface Aromatic{


String 
describeAroma
(); 
.
Notice the lack of �public�! Public is 
assumed
.


}


public interface Greasy{


double 
amountOfGreaseInMg
(); 
.
point out that interfaces look just like classes


}
but without fields or method bodies


public interface Edible{


double calories();


}



Implementing Interfaces


public class Bacon extends Pork implements Salty, Aromatic, Greasy, Edible {


private double 
amountInKg
;


public Bacon(double amount){


amountInKg
= amount;


}


public double calories(){


return 
amountInKg
* CALORIES_PER_KG_OF_BACON;


}


}

Generate your own class hierarchy that demonstrates the same 
concepts illustrated by the Financial Class Hierarchy outlines in 
the book. The extra credit project is due [in one week].
