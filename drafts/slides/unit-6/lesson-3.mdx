Interacting with the 
Object Superclass


[ 6.03 ] [ Today�s Date ] [ Instructor Name ]



The 
Object
Superclass


All classes are subclasses of the 
Object
class.


This means all objects inherit some methods:


toString
() 
//only ones on AP


equals()



Who remembers what 
toString
does?



Why can�t we just use 
==
to test for equality?



The standard == operator:


String z = �z�;
a == b


Evaluates to false because 
a
and 
b


String a = z + z;
refer to different strings.


String b = �
zz
�;
c == b


Evaluates to true because 
c
and 
b


String c = b;
refer to the same string.



The String 
equals
methods


a.equals
(b) 


/* evaluates to true because the content of a and b are the same */


c.equals
(b) 


/* evaluates to true because c and b refer to the same string */



Overriding the 
equals
method:


public 
boolean
equals(Object o){


Drink other = (Drink) o;


return 
name.equal
(other.name) && ounces == 
other.ounces
;


}


What does this let us compare?


What are some examples of where this can be useful?
