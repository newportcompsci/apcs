## Mystery

How do you think this program runs?

What is the output of this program?

```java
public class MethodsExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    message1();
    message2();
    System.out.println("Done with main.");
  }

  public static void message1() { 
    System.out.println("This is message1.");
  }

  public static void message2() { 
    System.out.println("This is message2.");
    message1(); // We can put methods inside methods!
    System.out.println("Done with message2.");
  }
}
```

---

## In this case, the program outputs:

```raw
This is message1.
This is message2.
This is message1.
Done with message2.
Done with main.
```

<div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr', gridColumnGap: '1em'}}>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
There's a 10 minute time limit.
Write a Java program called `StarFigures` that generates the following output

You *MUST* include a structure diagram or your answer will be disqualified

A correct answer will use static methods to show structure and eliminate redundancy in your solution
