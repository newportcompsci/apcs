# Static Methods and Method Calls

## Algorithms

A list of steps for solving a problem.

---

## Example Algorithm: 

```raw
bakeSugarCookies ()
  Mix the dry ingredients.
  Cream the butter and sugar.
  Beat in the eggs.
  Stir in the dry ingredients.
  Set the oven temperature.
  Set the timer.
  Place the cookies into the oven.
  Allow the cookies to bake.
  Spread the frosting and sprinkles onto the cookies. 
  etc.
```

---

## Problems with Algorithms

Lack of structure:
  Many tiny steps; tough to remember each step

Redundancy:
  Consider making a double batch

```raw
...
Stir in the dry ingredients
Set the oven temperature
Set the timer
Place the first batch of cookies into the oven
Allow the cookies to bake
Set the oven temperature
Set the timer
Place the second batch of cookies into the oven
Allow the cookies to bake
...
```

## Problems with Algorithms

Lack of structure:
  Many tiny steps; tough to remember each step

Redundancy:
  Consider making a double batch

```raw
...
Stir in the dry ingredients
Set the oven temperature
Set the timer
Place the first batch of cookies into the oven
Allow the cookies to bake
Set the oven temperature <- Why would you set the oven twice??
Set the timer
Place the second batch of cookies into the oven
Allow the cookies to bake
...
```

## Removing Redundancy

A well-structured algorithm can describe repeated tasks with less redundancy

```raw
makeCookieBatter()
  Mix in the dry ingredients.
  Mix wet ingredients.

bakeCookies()
  Put Cookies in Oven
  Set the Timer
```

---

## Removing Redundancy

By grouping steps and calling the groups, we can eliminate redundancy.

```raw 
makeCookieBatter()
Set oven temperature
bakeCookies()
bakeCookies()
Decorate Cookies
```

## Structure Diagram

Allows you to divide and conquer

Many batches of cookies
Make a batch of cookies

## Create a structure diagram for this set of stacked boxes:

```raw

### Static Methods

- A named group of statements


### Procedural decomposition: 
- dividing a problem into methods

> Writing a static method is like adding a new command to Java

---

## Using Static Methods

- Define / Declare the method
- Call (or run) the method

*Insider Tip* The main method always runs first

---

## Defining and Declaring a Method

Giving your method a name so it can be executed

Syntax:
```raw
public static void name (){
  statement;
  statement;
  statement;
}
```

---

## Example:
```java
public static void makeBatter (){
  System.out.println("Mix the dry ingredients.");
  System.out.println("Cream the butter/sugar.");
  System.out.println("Beat in the eggs.");
  System.out.println("Stir in dry ingredients.");
}
```

---

## Calling Static Methods

Executes the method's code

Syntax: 
```raw
<name>()
```

---

## Example: 
```java
makeBatter()
```

Output:
```raw
Mix the dry ingredients. 
Cream the butter/sugar
Beat in the eggs
Stir in dry ingredients
```

---

```java
// This program displays a delicious recipe for baking cookies.
public static void main(String[] args) {
  // Step 1: Make the cake batter.
  System.out.println("Mix the dry ingredients.");
  System.out.println("Cream the butter and sugar.");
  System.out.println("Beat in the eggs.");
  System.out.println("Stir in the dry ingredients.");

  // Step 2a: Bake cookies (first batch).
  System.out.println("Set the oven temperature.");
  System.out.println("Set the timer."); 
  System.out.println("Place a batch of cookies into the oven.");
  System.out.println("Allow the cookies to bake.");

  // Step 2b: Bake cookies (second batch).
  System.out.println("Set the oven temperature.");
  System.out.println("Set the timer.");
  System.out.println("Place a batch of cookies into the oven.");
  System.out.println("Allow the cookies to bake.");

  // Step 3: Decorate the cookies.
  System.out.println("Mix ingredients for frosting.");
  System.out.println("Spread frosting and sprinkles.");
}
```

---

```java
// This program displays a delicious recipe for baking cookies.
public class BakeCookies3 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    makeBatter();
    System.out.println("Set the oven temperature.");
    bake(); // 1st batch
    bake(); // 2nd batch
    decorate();
  }
  // Step 1: Make the cake batter.
  public static void makeBatter() {
    System.out.println("Mix the dry ingredients.");
    System.out.println("Cream the butter and sugar.");
    System.out.println("Beat in the eggs.");
    System.out.println("Stir in the dry ingredients.");
  }
  // Step 2: Bake a batch of cookies.
  public static void bake() {
    System.out.println("Set the timer.");
    System.out.println("Place batch into oven.");
    System.out.println("Allow the cookies to bake.");
  }
  // Step 3: Decorate the cookies.
  public static void decorate() {
    System.out.println("Mix ingredients for frosting.");
    System.out.println("Spread frosting and sprinkles.");
  }
}
```
