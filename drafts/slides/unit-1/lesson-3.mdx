## Brief History of Java

- Originally released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle)
- Wrote programs for "embedded devices", specifically TV's
- Turns out, this makes it ideal for writing programs for the internet

---

## Key Characteristics of Java

- Write once, run anywhere
- Automatic memory management
- Object-oriented

---

# Setup Eclipse 

---

## Your first program!

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
  System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
```

Put this inside the class curly braces { }

---

## Things to keep in mind!

- Don't forget the semicolon ( ; ) after the statement!
- Capital and lower case letters matter!
- Parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces are different! ( ) { } [ ]

---

# What is a string?

```java
"Hello World"
```

- A sequence of characters is called a string.
- Strings in Java are enclosed in double-quotes.

---

## Identify the string in 

```java
System.out.println("Hello World");
```

---

## println vs print

Replace: 
```java
System.out.println("");
```

with: 
```java
System.out.print("");
```

## What happened?

### What do you think is different?

## Escape Sequences

Why do you think we need escape sequences (or what are they!)?
- \n new line
- \" quotation mark
- \t tab
- \\\\ backslash
  - Why do we need this one?
