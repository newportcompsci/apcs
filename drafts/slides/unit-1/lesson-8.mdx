# Finding and Fixing Errors

---

Today's plan:

- Error check and resubmit all chapter 1 assignments
- Study for the test by:
  - Reviewing all of the blue, self-check pages at the end of Chapter 1
  - Re-reading sections as needed to complete the self-check problems

---

## Submit 5 questions for review in class tomorrow

---

## Homework Regrade/Resubmit

You all have the opportunity to get full credit on your homework grades by correcting them now, in class

Use your error checking algorithm, and if you need help just ask!

---

## Caveat: Style

In order to get your full credit, you'll need to restyle your code

In programming style is necessary We'll touch on a few major style guidelines

---

## Good Identifier Names

### Class Names

```java
MyProgram
CritterMain
```


### Method/Variable Names

```java
greatMethod1()
String firstName
int countOfX
```

---

## Use header, method, field, and inside-method commenting

Method commenting: 
```java
//Prints an introduction to programming style
```

Inside-method commenting: 
```java
//This variable is used to count your steps
```

> We'll introduce more commenting and style as we move along!

---

## Formatting:

Keep your lines under 100 characters of length, preferably 80 characters

## Redundancy:
We touched on this previously, but redundant code is bad style

*For advanced coders: Do not use break, break-like, or continue statements in your code! Also no empty return statements!
