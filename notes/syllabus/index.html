Programming is an incredibly rewarding skill
set to have in today’s modern world. Whether or not you want to go on to one
day work in the technology industry a survey of computer science is going to
serve you well in becoming an informed consumer. Going into this course I will
assume absolutely no prior programming experience. So, if you can’t tell a
bit from a byte or think that Java is just a name we give our coffee this class
is right for you if you’re willing to put in the effort. My first goal is work
with you so that you can walk away from this course and (if you decide to) feel
prepared enough to take a second semester of computer science in college.
My second goal is to prepare everyone to succeed on the AP test. I’m super
excited to go on this journey with you this year, and I hope you are too! </p><div class="css-1xswhls e1p7ddxt0">Skills and Prerequisites</div><p class="css-0">This class does not require any prior experience in computer programming.
However, there are a few skills that I expect all students to know: </p><style data-emotion-css="1uk1gs8">.css-1uk1gs8{margin:0;}</style><ul class="css-1uk1gs8"><li class="css-0">A basic understanding of how to use a computer (using a mouse and keyboard,
as well as knowing how to open and name files) </li><li class="css-0">Basic algebra and problem-solving skills </li><li class="css-0">Basic written communication skills </li><li class="css-0">An ability to learn from your mistakes  </li><li class="css-0">PERSISTENCE!  </li></ul><div class="css-1xswhls e1p7ddxt0">Course Materials 💻</div><ul class="css-1uk1gs8"><li class="css-0"><strong class="css-0">Computer</strong>: Students will be issued a school laptop which is perfectly suitable
for everything we will be doing in this class.</li><li class="css-0"><strong class="css-0">Notebook/Pen</strong>: I expect all students to write their notes in a physical
notebook throughout the lessons. </li><li class="css-0"><strong class="css-0">College Board Account</strong>: I highly encourage all students to take the AP exam
at the end of the year. If you plan on taking the test you are required to set
up an account on the College Board site and know your sign-in.  </li></ul><div class="css-1xswhls e1p7ddxt0">Textbook 📖</div><p class="css-0"><em class="css-0">Reges, S., &amp; Stepp, M. (2014). Building Java programs: A back to basics approach. Boston: Pearson.</em></p><div class="css-1xswhls e1p7ddxt0">Workload</div><p class="css-0">This is an AP level course that offers college credit and as such I expect students
to treat this class as one. This is a fast-paced class that covers a lot of material
so as a rule of thumb, a minimum of 15 to 20 minutes of coding a day is required to
be successful and ensure that you don’t fall behind. If you feel yourself falling
behind at any point in the class, please communicate that with me as soon as
possible so I can work with you to be successful.  </p><style data-emotion-css="d6uwb8">.css-d6uwb8{font-family:"Press Start 2P",sans-serif;line-height:1.5em;font-size:1.17em;margin:1em 0;font-weight:bold;}</style><div class="css-d6uwb8 e1p7ddxt0">Homework – 15%</div><p class="css-0">My views of homework are that it is there to help you learn as well as to help you
become successful for the projects and tests. What this doesn’t mean is that I
don’t assign homework, rather I assign homework daily. As the student this is
your opportunity to practice the content that we just covered in class and for you
to show me that you are making an honest attempt at trying it so that I can work
with you to learn from your mistakes before the test and you don’t make the mistakes
on the test day.  </p><p class="css-0">At the beginning of the unit I will provide you a sheet of all the homework that
will be assigned throughout the unit; this is just to give foresight to what’s to
come in the unit. I will assign homework each day so there’s no use worrying about
an assignment until I’ve assigned it. These will be a mixture of book work as well
as some problems on the practice-it website. For the most I will try to give you
enough time in class to finish it the day I’ve assigned it, and if you don’t then
you will have homework that night.  </p><p class="css-0">How will I grade these assignments? Good question! Throughout the unit I will ask
you to turn in an assignment that was previously assigned for me to check for
completion. Yes, completion. Remember, homework is a way for me to check to see if
you’re making an honest attempt at practice problems. With that said, I don’t
accept late homework, if it’s not done then you receive a zero. The reason for
this is because I provide plenty of time to work on homework and your homework
grade reflects your attempt of the practice problems… not how fast you can do them
last minute.  </p><div class="css-d6uwb8 e1p7ddxt0">Projects – 35%</div><p class="css-0">There will be one main project assigned per quarter, plus a couple of smaller
projects at the beginning of the first quarter. Projects will be assigned several
weeks in advance of their due dates, and there will be occasional checkpoints to
confirm that students are on track. Major projects will be graded out of 100
points, and a grading scheme will be provided with each assignment. Minor
projects will have varying point values. Projects will make up a significant
portion of your grade and will also be your primary opportunity to apply the
concepts you are learning in an actual software engineering context. It is
imperative that you put the appropriate amount of time and effort into your
&#x27;projects. Start early, work on them consistently, and always ask for help if
you are having trouble. </p><p class="css-0">Unlike homework, projects can be accepted late at a cost. You can expect to lose
about 5% per day for late work capped at 20% meaning that the most you can earn is
an 80% on the project turned in more than 4 days late. If the project is going to
be turned in more than 4 days late you MUST communicate with me to make a new
timeline. Remember, it is ALWAYS better to turn in late work than not at all! </p><div class="css-d6uwb8 e1p7ddxt0">Tests/Quizzes – 50%</div><p class="css-0">A test or quiz will be given at the end of each unit. Quizzes will cover only the
material from the most recent unit, while tests will cover material from multiple
units. The exact material covered will be announced prior to each test or quiz.
Vocabulary quizzes will be on needed basis and can be pop quizzes. </p><p class="css-0">I don’t allow for retakes (unless under special circumstances). However, if you
were absent on the day of the test you MUST schedule a time with me to take it.  </p><div class="css-1xswhls e1p7ddxt0">Expectations</div><p class="css-0">Students are expected to behave appropriately always in class. Students must be
attentive and ready to learn and should actively participate in classroom
activities. This includes taking notes and asking questions during lecture
time and working on assigned activities during lab time. Students are also
expected to be paying attention and not using their computers during lectures
and classroom discussions; computers must only be used during dedicated lab time
and then only on assigned material. All assignments must be completed and turned
in on time, and students must be proactive about speaking to the course staff
about issues. In addition, all NHS rules and policies must be followed and
respected always. </p><div class="css-1xswhls e1p7ddxt0">Cellphones 📱</div><p class="css-0">Students are expected to put their phone in the pockets at the front of the room
during class unless the teacher states otherwise. Phones can be picked up one
minute before the bell rings at the end of class. Part of the professionalism
points that students earn comes from students showing me when they come into the
class each day they are here and ready to learn. Students show me this by telling
me that they can live without their phone for the time they are in the classroom
by placing it in the phone pockets. If a student doesn’t have a phone, all I ask
is that they get their parents to email me or write a quick note indicating such.  </p><div class="css-1xswhls e1p7ddxt0">Other Policies 🍔</div><ul class="css-1uk1gs8"><li class="css-0">Food is not permitted in the classroom and drinks must be in a closed container </li><li class="css-0">All content you create (text, images, etc.) must be school appropriate </li><li class="css-0">Questions are ALWAYS welcome and are encouraged. Questioning shows that we
are wanting to learn and are making an honest attempt to uncover the truth of
a subject.  </li></ul><div class="css-1xswhls e1p7ddxt0">Calendar 📆</div><style data-emotion-css="1j9hpr8">.css-1j9hpr8{width:100%;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:0;}</style><table class="css-1j9hpr8"><thead><tr class="css-0"><style data-emotion-css="1eqt6ww">.css-1eqt6ww{text-align:left;padding-right:.5em;padding-top:.25em;padding-bottom:.25em;border-bottom:1px solid;vertical-align:top;}</style><th class="css-1eqt6ww">Unit</th><th class="css-1eqt6ww">Title</th><th class="css-1eqt6ww">Timeline*</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="css-0"><td class="css-1eqt6ww">1</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">Programming and Java</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">2 weeks</td></tr><tr class="css-0"><td class="css-1eqt6ww">2</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">Working Data and Basic Control Flow</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">3 weeks</td></tr><tr class="css-0"><td class="css-1eqt6ww">3</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">Advanced Data and Control Flow</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">4 weeks</td></tr><tr class="css-0"><td class="css-1eqt6ww">4</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">Arrays, Lists, and Files</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">4 weeks</td></tr><tr class="css-0"><td class="css-1eqt6ww">5</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">Object-Oriented Programming</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">4 weeks</td></tr><tr class="css-0"><td class="css-1eqt6ww">6</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">Inheritance and Polymorphism</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">4 weeks</td></tr><tr class="css-0"><td class="css-1eqt6ww">7</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">Searching and Sorting</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">3 weeks</td></tr><tr class="css-0"><td class="css-1eqt6ww">8</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">Recursion</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">2 weeks</td></tr><tr class="css-0"><td class="css-1eqt6ww">9</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">AP Test Review</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">3 weeks</td></tr><tr class="css-0"><td class="css-1eqt6ww">10</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">Post-AP Projects</td><td class="css-1eqt6ww">4-5 weeks</td></tr></tbody></table><style data-emotion-css="1msjh1x">.css-1msjh1x{font-style:italic;}</style><blockquote class="css-1msjh1x evsege50"><p class="css-0">*Timeline is an approximation and subject to change.</p></blockquote><div class="css-1xswhls e1p7ddxt0">Dual Credit / Pacific Nortwest College (PNW) Credit</div><p class="css-0">This course is a CTE Dual Credit approved and articulated course with Bellevue
