# Random Numbers

## When do we use randomization?


- Create an enemy that spawns after some random amount of time, but between 7 
and 23 seconds.

- Pick a random item from a list of 100 words the user needs to guess in Hangman

- Create a new username between 6 and 10 characters picking randomly what each 
character is, from lower/capital letters and numbers.

- Make a ball bounce, but not precisely, by adding random angles to the bounce.

## Let's make some random numbers:

> How do we make a random object?

```java
// Top of file 
import java.util.Random;

Random r = new Random();

result = r.nextInt(6); //Gives a number between 0 and 5
result = r.nextInt(6) + 1; //between 1 and 6.
System.out.println("You rolled a " + result);
```

## Think-Pair-Share

- Write an expression that simulates a roll of a 20-sided dice.
- Write an expression that yields a random number between 0.0 and 1.0.

## Think-Pair-Share

```java
Random r = new Random();
int diceRoll = r.nextInt(20) + 1;
double randDouble = r.nextDouble() // or Math.random()
```

## Lab

Using everything we have learned so far in Unit 3 (loops, conditions, Scanner, Random) 
try to put these pieces together to create some sort of game. 

**Criteria**
- Must have at least one while loop 
- Must take user input through the scanner 
- Must use a static method with parameters AND returns a value 
- Must use Random numbers 
- Must use conditions
