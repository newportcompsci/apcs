# While Loops

---

## Definite Loops

Executes a known number of times.
- Print "hello" 10 times.
- Find all the prime numbers up to integer n.
- Print each odd number between 5 and 127.

---


## Indefinite loops: 

One where the number of times it's run is not known.
- Prompts the user until they type a non-negative number.
- Print random numbers until a prime number is printed.
- Repeat until the user types 'q' to quit.

---

## The while loop:

Repeatedly executes its body as long as the test is true.

```java
while (test) {
    statements(s);
}
```

---

## Example:

```java
int num = 1;

while (num <= 200) {
    System.out.print(num + " ");
    num = num * 2;
}
```

---

## Example 2 (while loop):

```java
int i = 0;

while (i < 10) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++; 
}
```

---

## Example 2 (while loop):

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i ++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

---

# What's the difference?

How many times does this loop execute? 
What is the output?

---

## Try rewrite this loop as a for loop.

```java
int n = 91; 
int factor = 2;

while (n % factor != 0) {
    factor++;
}

System.out.println("First factor is " + factor);
```
