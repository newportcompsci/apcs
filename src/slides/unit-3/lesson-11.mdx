# Reducing Redundancy

---

## Classroom Competition

Factor out redundant code from the following example by moving it 
out of the if/else statement, preserving the same output.

---

## Challenge 1

---

```java
if (x < 30) { 
    a = 2; 
    x++; 
System.out.println("Spongebob Squarepants! " + x); 
} else { 
    a = 2; 
    System.out.println("Spongebob Squarepants! " + x); 
}
```

---

## Challenge 2

---

```java
int sum = 1000; 
scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);

// You can assume they will only enter 1 OR 2
system.out.print("Is your money multiplied 1 or 2 times? ");
int times = console.nextInt(); 

if (times == 1) { 
    System.out.print("And how much are you contributing? "); 
    int donation = console.nextInt(); 
    sum = sum + donation; 
    count1++; 
    total = total + donation; 
} 
if (times == 2) { 
    system.out.print("And how much are you contributing? "); 
    int donation = console.nextInt(); 
    sum = sum + 2 * donation; 
    count2++; 
    total = total + donation; 
}
```
