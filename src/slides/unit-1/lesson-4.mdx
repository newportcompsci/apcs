## Logical Errors (bugs)

Buggy or poorly written programs

![Computer Bug](https://pageproofer.com/img/the-first-computer-bug.jpg)

---

## Syntax Errors

Bad grammar in Java

Syntax errors include misspelled words, forgotten semicolons, and 
missing words

--- 

## Can you spot the errors? 

```java
public static main(String[] args) {
  System.out.pruntln(""); 
  system.out.println("");
```

---

## Runtime Errors

So severe that Java stops executing.

These errors occur when a bug causes your computer to be unable to 
continue executing.

---

## Error - Checking Algorithm

- Step 1: Check all code for spelling errors.
- Step 2: Check all code for punctuation errors (curly brackets, brackets, parentheses, and semicolons).
- Step 3: Check all code for syntax errors.

---

## Checking for bugs:

 - File name matches class name
 - All code is spelled correctly
 - All code is capitalized correctly
 - All statements end in a semicolon
 - Keywords are included.
 - Strings are enclosed in "quotation marks"
 - There are no extra punctuation marks.
 - All header open - braces are paired with closed - braces

## Documentation

refers to the elements of the code that help a reader 
understand what's going on (even as the coder!)

---

## Single line comments:

```java
// this is a single
```

## Multi-line (or C-style) comments:

```java
/* this is a
  multi - line comment */
```

Comments are ignored when your code in compiled

---

## Documentation

- Use comments to explain your code
- Describe a behavior of your code
- Explain anything potentially unclear
- Explain why you did something a certain way

---

## Your code should self-document by:

- Using readable and descriptive names
- Use line breaks to increase legibility
- Indenting/aligning things well

---

## Identifiers

The names of classes, methods, variables, etc are identifiers

Descriptive, but not unwieldy

- Bad: x (non-descriptive), myVariableThatIsReallyBig (too long)
- Good: count, numTries , xCoordinate

---

## Identifiers

Identifiers are always a single word.

Class names should use uppercase letters at the start of each word:
> E.g. ClassName, PrintStream, Car

Variables/methods/etc. should be in camelCase
> E.g. size, numLoops, firstName
