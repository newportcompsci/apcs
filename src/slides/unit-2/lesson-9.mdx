# For loop review

---

## Warm-up

> Write a program that produces the following output using nested for loops:

```raw
\:::::::/
 \:::::/
  \:::/ 
   \:/
   /:\
  /:::\
 /:::::\
/:::::::\
```

**TIPS**: Start with a structure diagram. Isolate repeated tasks into methods. Include 
comments in with your code so others can easily understand your code.
