# Declaring and Assigning Variables

## Discuss

> Turn and talk with your partner what sort's of conversions you need to 
> calculate throughout the day. How do you go about calculating those conversions? 

---

## Variables

- A piece of the computer's memory that is given a name and type 
- Can store a value

> Example: preset station on a car stereo or cell phone speed dial

---

## Step 1: Declare the variable

Sets aside memory for storing a value

Variables must be declared before the variable can be used

Syntax:

```raw
<type> <variable name>;
```

---

## String is the type we have learned so far

`name` is an identifier

Naming convention is camel casing: lower case first letter

Example: 
```java
String myStringVar;
int myCounter;
```

---

## Exercise 1:

```raw
int age;
int ageeeeeeee;
int age 
int thisIsAReallyLongVariableName;
int my age;
int my.age;
int "age";
int my;age;
int my;age;
int; hello;
int hello;
```

---

## Exercise 2

> Write down the code that tells Java to declare an int variable with the name of `color`

---

## Step 2: Assign the variable

Stores a value to the space reserved for the variable

Syntax:

```raw
<variable name> = <expression>;
```

> the value stored can be updated as many times as needed 

---

## Variable Assignment 

```java 
myCounter = 0;

// We'll learn a better way to do this later
myCounter = (myCounter + 1); 
```

---

## Exercise 3: 

```raw 
age = 17;
age == 17;
age = "seventeen";
age = 17
age = (age + 1);
Age = 17;
age = (Age + 1);
17 = age;
age 17
age = 20,000;
age = 17.000;
age = $17
age = ;
age is 17;
```

---

## Assignment and Declaring

a value can be assigned the same time it is declared:

```raw
<type> <variable name> = <expression>;
```

Example:

```java
int age = 17; 

// is the same as 
 int age;
 age = 17;
```

---

## Exercise 4:

```raw
int age is 17;
int; hello = 5;
int "age" = "17";
int money = $3,000;
int; hello = 5;
int hello = 5;
int ageeeeeeee = 17eeeeeeeee;
int h = 0;
int t =;
```

---

## Step 3: Using the variable

The variable's name can be used wherever you need to use that value

Syntax:
```java
String value = "Hello";
System.out.println(value);
String valueWithNewline = value + "\n";
```

---

## The variable can be used as many times as needed

changing the variable's value will be reflected in the code that used the variable 
later in the execution


Example:

```java
String myStringVar = "Hello there";
System.out.println(myStringVar);
myStringVar = "Goodbye";
System.out.println(myStringVar);
```

Output:

```raw
hello there
Goodbye
```

---

## Exercise 5a

```java 
int variableOne = 1;
int variableTwo = 4;
int variableThree  = variableOne + variableTwo;
variableOne = variableTwo
```

> What are the values in all of the variables here?

---

## Exercise 5b

```java
int candies = 70;
int studentsInClass = 15;
int candiesPerStudent = candies / studentsInClass;
int candiesLeftOver = candies % studentsInClass;
```

---

## Exercise 5c

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 100;
int c = 1000;
int d = a + b + c;
int e = d - a;
int f = 10 * e;
```

---

## Exercise 6 

```raw 
String greeting = "Hello, world.";
String greeting = "Hello, world;".
String greeting is "Hello, world.";
String greeting = "Hello, woooooooorld.";
String "greeting" = "Hello, world.";
String "hello, world." = greeting;
String myString = "My age is (17 + 1)";
String myString = "My age is " + (17 + 1);
String what'sUp = "How are you?";
String hello = "how are you?"
String goodbye = 'See you later';
Striiiiiiiing greeting = "Hello, world.";
String greetiiiiiiiiing = "Hello, world.";
```

---

## Common Complier Errors

- A variable cannot be used until it is assigned
- Variable names cannot be declared twice
- If the variable name is mistyped, the compiler will say the variable is undeclared
