# Mixing Types & Casting

---

### Zombies, Werewolves, and Humans


> What do you think would happen if a zombie bit a werewolf?


> So : Zombie > Werewolf > Human?


Same thing happens when we mix together different types

---

### Strings, doubles, and integers


> Think about our past examples:

```java
1 + 9.0 = 10.0
1 + "hello" = "1hello"
1 + 2.0 + "hello" = "3.0hello"
```

> So: String > double > int

---

- If you combine an int and a double with an operator (+ - * / % ) the result is a double

- If you combine an int and a String with a `+` the result is a String 

- If you combine an double and a String with a `+` the result is a String?

## Promoting

> In Java we call this promoting!

```java
int intVal = 1;
double doubleVal = 1.0;
String strVal = "1";
```

## Introduction to Casting

```java
(int) 4.29 // -> 4
(double) 1 // -> 1.0
```

### Note: 

String is not a primitive type and cannot be cast. Java will convert int and double to strings when concatenated with a string.

---

## String Casting / Parsing

```java
"" + 4.892 // -> "4.982"
```

###  Note

> There is a trick to turning a String into a primitive though... Using Wrapper Classes

---

## Wrapper Classes

```java
Integer.parseInt("4") // -> 4
Double.parseDouble("4.982") // -> 4.982
Integer.parseInt("4.982") // -> Runtime Exception!
Double.parseDouble("4") // -> 4.0
```
