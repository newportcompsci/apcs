# Scope and Pseudocode

---

```java
public class ScopePractice {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("I see no variables here.");
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            System.out.println("i is " + i);
        }
        System.out.println("I see no variables here either.");
        System.out.println("The value of i is " i); // <- Error!
    }
}

```

For for loops, the scope is relatively straightforward: any variable declared in the initialize part of the for loop is valid only inside the for loop itself.

Determining the scope of other variable declarations requires more processing:

- Work backward from the variable declaration to find the first left curly brace symbol {, then find the matching right curly brace }.

- The variable’s scope is the section of the Java program starting at the variable declaration and ending at the right curly brace you just found.

---

```java 
public class ScopePractice {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, world"); // <- X does not exist here

        int x = 100; // <- X's scope start
        System.out.println("The value of x is " + x);
    } // <- X's scope end
}

```

### There are some important rules about scope:

- Attempting to use the variable outside of the variable’s scope is in an error.
- It is also an error to use a variable from one method in a different method, even if the second method was called from inside the variable’s scope.
- You can’t have two variables with the same name with overlapping scope.
- You can have two variables with the same name as long as their scopes don’t overlap.

```java
public class ScopePractice {
    public static void fancyMethod() {
        int d = 7;
        System.out.println("d is " + d);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int c = 10;
        fancyMethod();
        int b = 100;
        System.out.println("c is " + c);
        anotherFancyMethod();
        System.out.println("b is " + b);
    }

    public static void anotherFancyMethod() {
        int a = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            int e = 42;
            System.out.println("e is " + e);
        }
        System.out.println("a is " + a);
    }
}
```

## Worksheet Part 1

- Draw a box around the scope of the variable  a and label the box.

- Draw a box around the scope of the variable  b and label the box.

- Draw a box around the scope of the variable  c and label the box.

- Draw a box around the scope of the variable  d and label the box.

- Draw a box around the scope of the variable  e and label the box.
