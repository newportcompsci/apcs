# String Concatenation and Increment

---

## Intro to String Concatenation : Expressions with Strings

```java
"hello" + 4 = "hello4"

"hello" + 4 + 2 = "hello42"

4 + 2 + "hello" = "6hello"

"hello" + (4 + 2) = "hello6"

"hello" + 4 * 2 = "hello8"
```

---

## More Examples:

```java
1 + 2 + 3 + "chocolate" = ??? 

"chocolate"+ 1 + 2 + 3 = ???

"chocolate"+ (1 + 2) + 3 = ???

"chocolate"+ (1 + 2) / 3 = ???
```

---

Examples

```java
System.out.println("Spongebob thinks " 
    + "the best time to wear a sweater" 
    + " is all the time!");

System.out.println("Here we combine " + 1 + " integer" + " with strings!");

System.out.println(42 + " is the answer to" + "everything!" + 1 + 1)
```

## Introduction to Increment


> In Java, there are ways to increase/decrease a variable without writing 
> the whole equation!

```java
x += 7; // The same as -> x = x + 7; 

y /= 3; // The same as -> y = y / 3 ; 

// Both are the same as x = x + 1
x++; // use then change
++x; // change then use
```

## Rules 

- Get into 6 groups
- Each group starts with 10 points
- Each group will take turns answering questions
- If your group gets their question correct they can:
  - Take 2 points from any team OR
  - Take a shot from the 2-point line or 3-point line
    - 2-point line: Take 3 points 
    - 3-point line: Take 5 points
- You may distribute your points between multiple teams
