# Project 

Write a program that produces calendars as output. Your program should have a method that outputs a single 
month's calendar like the one below, given parameters to specifiy how many days are in the month and what 
date the first Sunday in the month is. In the month shown below, these values are 31 and 6, respectively. 
Your program should also prompt a user for this input and then show the result. 

```raw 
  Sun    Mon    Tue    Wed    Thu    Fri    Sat 
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
|      |      |   1  |   2  |   3  |   4  |   5  |
|   6  |   7  |   8  |   9  |  10  |  11  |  12  |
|  13  |  14  |  15  |  16  |  17  |  18  |  19  |
|  20  |  21  |  22  |  23  |  24  |  25  |  26  |
|  27  |  28  |  29  |  30  |  31  |      |      |
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
```

One tricky part of this program is making the various columns line up properly with proper widths. We 
will learn better ways of formatting test later. For now you will have to use what we have learned so 
far about type casting and loops to properly format the string.

*Hint*: you should have **at least** two static methods each of which take two parameters.
