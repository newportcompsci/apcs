# Welcome to AP Computer Science!

## Course Overview

Welcome to AP Computer Science! Programming is an incredibly rewarding skill 
set to have in today’s modern world. Whether or not you want to go on to one 
day work in the technology industry a survey of computer science is going to 
serve you well in becoming an informed consumer. Going into this course I will 
assume absolutely no prior programming experience. So, if you can’t tell a 
bit from a byte or think that Java is just a name we give our coffee this class 
is right for you if you’re willing to put in the effort. My first goal is work 
with you so that you can walk away from this course and (if you decide to) feel 
prepared enough to take a second semester of computer science in college. 
My second goal is to prepare everyone to succeed on the AP test. I’m super 
excited to go on this journey with you this year, and I hope you are too! 

## Skills and Prerequisites 

This class does not require any prior experience in computer programming. 
However, there are a few skills that I expect all students to know: 

- A basic understanding of how to use a computer (using a mouse and keyboard, 
  as well as knowing how to open and name files) 
- Basic algebra and problem-solving skills 
- Basic written communication skills 
- An ability to learn from your mistakes  
- PERSISTENCE!  

## Course Materials :computer:

- **Computer**: Students will be issued a school laptop which is perfectly suitable 
  for everything we will be doing in this class.
- **Notebook/Pen**: I expect all students to write their notes in a physical 
  notebook throughout the lessons. 
- **College Board Account**: I highly encourage all students to take the AP exam 
  at the end of the year. If you plan on taking the test you are required to set 
  up an account on the College Board site and know your sign-in.  

## Textbook :book:

## Workload

This is an AP level course that offers college credit and as such I expect students 
to treat this class as one. This is a fast-paced class that covers a lot of material 
so as a rule of thumb, a minimum of 15 to 20 minutes of coding a day is required to
be successful and ensure that you don’t fall behind. If you feel yourself falling 
behind at any point in the class, please communicate that with me as soon as 
possible so I can work with you to be successful.  

### Homework – 15% 

My views of homework are that it is there to help you learn as well as to help you 
become successful for the projects and tests. What this doesn’t mean is that I 
don’t assign homework, rather I assign homework daily. As the student this is 
your opportunity to practice the content that we just covered in class and for you 
to show me that you are making an honest attempt at trying it so that I can work 
with you to learn from your mistakes before the test and you don’t make the mistakes 
on the test day.  

At the beginning of the unit I will provide you a sheet of all the homework that 
will be assigned throughout the unit; this is just to give foresight to what’s to 
come in the unit. I will assign homework each day so there’s no use worrying about 
an assignment until I’ve assigned it. These will be a mixture of book work as well 
as some problems on the practice-it website. For the most I will try to give you 
enough time in class to finish it the day I’ve assigned it, and if you don’t then 
you will have homework that night.  

How will I grade these assignments? Good question! Throughout the unit I will ask 
you to turn in an assignment that was previously assigned for me to check for 
completion. Yes, completion. Remember, homework is a way for me to check to see if 
you’re making an honest attempt at practice problems. With that said, I don’t 
accept late homework, if it’s not done then you receive a zero. The reason for 
this is because I provide plenty of time to work on homework and your homework 
grade reflects your attempt of the practice problems… not how fast you can do them 
last minute.  

### Projects – 35% 

There will be one main project assigned per quarter, plus a couple of smaller 
projects at the beginning of the first quarter. Projects will be assigned several 
weeks in advance of their due dates, and there will be occasional checkpoints to 
confirm that students are on track. Major projects will be graded out of 100 
points, and a grading scheme will be provided with each assignment. Minor
projects will have varying point values. Projects will make up a significant 
portion of your grade and will also be your primary opportunity to apply the 
concepts you are learning in an actual software engineering context. It is 
imperative that you put the appropriate amount of time and effort into your 
'projects. Start early, work on them consistently, and always ask for help if 
you are having trouble. 

Unlike homework, projects can be accepted late at a cost. You can expect to lose 
about 5% per day for late work capped at 20% meaning that the most you can earn is 
an 80% on the project turned in more than 4 days late. If the project is going to 
be turned in more than 4 days late you MUST communicate with me to make a new 
timeline. Remember, it is ALWAYS better to turn in late work than not at all! 

### Tests/Quizzes – 50% 

A test or quiz will be given at the end of each unit. Quizzes will cover only the 
material from the most recent unit, while tests will cover material from multiple 
units. The exact material covered will be announced prior to each test or quiz. 
Vocabulary quizzes will be on needed basis and can be pop quizzes. 

I don’t allow for retakes (unless under special circumstances). However, if you 
were absent on the day of the test you MUST schedule a time with me to take it.  

## Expectations 

Students are expected to behave appropriately always in class. Students must be 
attentive and ready to learn and should actively participate in classroom 
activities. This includes taking notes and asking questions during lecture 
time and working on assigned activities during lab time. Students are also 
expected to be paying attention and not using their computers during lectures 
and classroom discussions; computers must only be used during dedicated lab time 
and then only on assigned material. All assignments must be completed and turned 
in on time, and students must be proactive about speaking to the course staff 
about issues. In addition, all NHS rules and policies must be followed and 
respected always. 

## Cellphones :iphone:

Students are expected to put their phone in the pockets at the front of the room 
during class unless the teacher states otherwise. Phones can be picked up one 
minute before the bell rings at the end of class. Part of the professionalism 
points that students earn comes from students showing me when they come into the 
class each day they are here and ready to learn. Students show me this by telling 
me that they can live without their phone for the time they are in the classroom 
by placing it in the phone pockets. If a student doesn’t have a phone, all I ask 
is that they get their parents to email me or write a quick note indicating such.  

## Other Policies :hamburger:

- Food is not permitted in the classroom and drinks must be in a closed container 
- All content you create (text, images, etc.) must be school appropriate 
- Questions are ALWAYS welcome and are encouraged. Questioning shows that we 
  are wanting to learn and are making an honest attempt to uncover the truth of 
  a subject.

## TEALS

Newport High School is a part of the TEALS program meaning that industry professionals 
will be in the classroom assisting students with their computer science work. 
These people are all volunteers and are to be treated the same way they would 
treat any other teacher. Mr. Rasmussen will still be the main point of contact 
for all issues pertaining grades and school specific issues. TEALS volunteers are 
to be used as a resource specifically towards the content being learned. More information
can be found at the [TEALS Website](https://tealsk12.org).
