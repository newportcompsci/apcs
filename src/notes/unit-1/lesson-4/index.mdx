## Logical Errors (bugs)

Buggy or poorly written programs

![Computer Bug](https://pageproofer.com/img/the-first-computer-bug.jpg)

## Syntax Errors

Bad grammar in Java

Syntax errors include misspelled words, forgotten semicolons, and 
missing words

## Runtime Errors

So severe that Java stops executing.

These errors occur when a bug causes your computer to be unable to 
continue executing.

## TIPS: Checking for bugs:

 - File name matches class name
 - All code is spelled correctly
 - All code is capitalized correctly
 - All statements end in a semicolon
 - Keywords are included.
 - Strings are enclosed in "quotation marks"
 - There are no extra punctuation marks.
 - All header open - braces are paired with closed - braces

## Documentation

refers to the elements of the code that help a reader 
understand what's going on (even as the coder!)

### Single line comments:

```java
// this is a single
```

### Multi-line (or C-style) comments:

```java
/* this is a
  multi - line comment */
```

Comments are ignored when your code in compiled

## Identifiers

The names of classes, methods, variables, etc are identifiers

Descriptive, but not unwieldy

- Bad: x (non-descriptive), myVariableThatIsReallyBig (too long)
- Good: count, numTries , xCoordinate

Class names should use uppercase letters at the start of each word:
> E.g. ClassName, PrintStream, Car

Variables/methods/etc. should be in camelCase
> E.g. size, numLoops, firstName
