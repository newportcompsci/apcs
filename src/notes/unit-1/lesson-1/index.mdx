## Hello world

Open up Eclipse and create a new `Java Project`. 

Right click on the java project and create a new `class` named `HelloWorld`. This should
create a new file called `HelloWorld.java`. In that file copy and paste the following code. 

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world");
    }
}
```

Right click on the file and select `Run as Java Project` 

## Eclipse Cheat Sheets 

Eclipse has a cheat sheet that can be used to guide you through the above process as well. 

In the tool bar locate "Help" and select "Cheat Sheets". This will bring up a menu where 
if you select Create a "Hello World application" a guide will pop up to walk you through the process. 

## Congrats!

You just ran you first java program!
